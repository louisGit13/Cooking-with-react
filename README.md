# TINY README Template

This is a TINY (TINY Is Not YART ([Yet](https://github.com/CarsonChen1129/README-template) [Another](https://gist.github.com/zsim0n/1d943a0f3e5af59e1e1d91a3a1e9eae1) [README](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme/issues/117) Template)) README template. Put a brief description of the project here, and optionally include a screenshot with a nice frame:

## Description

Longer description explaining the rationale/intent behind the project, what it's good for, and how it works. If the next two subsections are short enough, they can be merged up into this block—perhaps as bulleted lists.

### Features

- It's TINY. A short README is a good README.
- List other standout qualities that'll make a potential user want to try out your project.

### Built with

- Markdown
- Love

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Dependencies not explicitly covered in the installation process; e.g., OS restrictions.

### Install

Ideally, write a script whose usage is described here.

### Configure

Manual, context-specific tasks not covered in the installation process.

### Usage

GIFs are useful here to see the project in action.

### Troubleshooting

Or FAQs, if that's more appropriate.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
